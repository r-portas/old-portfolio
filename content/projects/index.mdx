# Projects

Recently I've been working on a few projects in my spare time, most of these are available Github.

## 2020: Brisbane Buses

I spent a bit of time playing around with GTFS realtime feeds
published by Translink.
GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) is a Google specification for public transport data,
its how Google Maps displays public transport information. 

The GTFS realtime feeds receives updates around every 5 seconds,
so to give you an idea of the volume of data, every 5 seconds it publishes around 700 bus updates.

The backend is written in NodeJS, which takes the protobuf encoded GTFS realtime feed and 
publishes it as a GraphQL api (using GraphQL subscriptions to send down realtime updates to the clients).

The frontend is written in React and uses MapboxGL for the map.

The whole application is deployed using Docker, with 3 containers:
- A container that hosts the static frontend using NGINX
- A container that hosts the backend NodeJS application
- Traefik that acts as a proxy for the other containers.

## 2019: Real Estate

I moving apartments in 2019 and wanted a better way to search for potential apartments near the suburbs I want to move to.
This was also an excuse for me to delve into Vue.js, Node and Typescript.

What I wanted from the project is a simple site allowing me to easily view all available apartments in the suburbs I'm interested.
I decided to extend the idea a bit more and added:

- A table view of apartments with information about them

- A map view showing all apartments on a map
