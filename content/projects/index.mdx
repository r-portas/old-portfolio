# Projects

Recently I've been working on a few projects in my spare time, most of these are available Github.

## 2019: Real Estate

I moving apartments in 2019 and wanted a better way to search for potential apartments near the suburbs I want to move to.
This was also an excuse for me to delve into Vue.js, Node and Typescript.

What I wanted from the project is a simple site allowing me to easily view all available apartments in the suburbs I'm interested.
I decided to extend the idea a bit more and added:

- A table view of apartments with information about them

  ![Real Estate Table](./real_estate_table.png)

- A map view showing all apartments on a map
  ![Real Estate Map](./real_estate_map.png)
