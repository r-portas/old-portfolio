Installing Docker on Fedora 32 is a bit tricky, namely for these reasons:

- There isn't an official repo for Fedora 32 yet, in the meantime we have to use Fedora 31
- `firewalld` now uses `nftables` as the default backend but Docker seems to only work with `iptables`
- Fedora switched to cgroups v2, but Docker doesn't support it yet

Luckily fixing these are pretty straight forward, I've coded these up into an Ansible task

```yml
- name: replace release version with 31
  become: yes
  replace:
    path: /etc/yum.repos.d/docker-ce.repo
    regexp: "\\$releasever"
    replace: "31"

- name: enable backwards compatibility for cgroups
  become: yes
  shell: grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args="systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=0"

- name: use iptables as firewalld backend over nftables
  become: yes
  replace:
    path: /etc/firewalld/firewalld.conf
    regexp: "FirewallBackend=nftables"
    replace: "FirewallBackend=iptables"
```
