I've been following the development of [Traefik](https://docs.traefik.io/) for some time, since it was originally inducted
into the CNCF foundation.

They recently released version 2 so I figured I'd give it a go to deploy some infrastructure that I use,
namely [Matomo](https://matomo.org/) and [Drone](https://drone.io/).

I usually use Nginx as a reverse proxy installed on the host operating system and configure it as a reverse proxy to my containers.
However I was reading over the Traefik docs and it seems to provide an even easier way to configure routing.

To get started I'm gonna create a new `docker-compose.yml` file to store my configuration. if you want to follow along create a new folder put the following `docker-compose.yml` in it.

```yaml
version: "3"

services:
  reverse-proxy:
    image: traefik:v2.2
    command:
      #- "--log.level=DEBUG"
      #- "--api.insecure=true"
      - "--providers.docker=true"
      - "--providers.docker.exposedbydefault=false"
      - "--entrypoints.web.address=:80"
      - "--entrypoints.websecure.address=:443"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.letsencrypt.acme.httpchallenge=true"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.letsencrypt.acme.httpchallenge.entrypoint=web"
      # - "--certificatesresolvers.letsencrypt.acme.caserver=https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.letsencrypt.acme.email=postmaster@example.com"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.letsencrypt.acme.storage=/letsencrypt/acme.json"
    ports:
      # The HTTP port
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
      # The Web UI (enabled by --api.insecure=true)
      #- "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      # So that Traefik can listen to the Docker events
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      # Persist the letsencrypt config to disk (e.g. certs, etc.)
      - ./letsencrypt:/letsencrypt

# Connect to the external network called "shared"
# needs to be manually created first
networks:
  default:
    external:
      name: shared
```

This configures Traefik to run as a reverse proxy exposed on 80 (for http) and 443 (for https).
Before this will work you need to create an Docker network that is to be shared between docker-compose stacks, use the following command:

```bash
docker network create shared
```
