I find that setting up a Typescript project usually takes some time, as it involves doing some googling to figure out how to set up all the tools. I figured I do it enough that its worth writing a quick reference for getting set up.

```bash
mkdir myproject
cd myproject
npm init
```

Once that is done, lets add some dependencies

```bash
npm i -D typescript ts-node @types/node
```

Now lets create a `tsconfig.json` to store our Typescript configuration

```json
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "commonjs",
    "strict": true,
    "outDir": "./dist"
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "**/*.test.ts"]
}
```

This is a fairly minimal `tsconfig.json` that can be extended if need be.

Lets create an entrypoint for our program, create a new folder called `src` and create a file called `main.ts` inside it

```ts
// src/main.ts
console.log("Hello world!")
```

Now we will add some scripts to the `package.json`

```json
// package.json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    "dev": "ts-node src/main.ts"
  }
}
```

Now you should be able to run `npm run dev` and see "Hello world!" printed to the screen.

## Setting up testing with Jest (optional)

Its always good practise to write some tests, next lets add Jest to our project and configure it

```bash
npm i -D jest ts-jest @types/jest
```

Now lets create configuration file for Jest

```js
// jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  preset: "ts-jest",
  testEnvironment: "node",
}
```

After that, add a entry in your `package.json` to execute the tests

```js
// package.json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "test": "jest"
  }
}
```

Next create a sample test to verify that Jest works correctly

```ts
// src/example.test.ts
test("sample test", () => {
  expect(1 + 1).toEqual(2)
})
```

Then run `npm run test`

If it all works correctly, you'll see the test output and the tests passing.
