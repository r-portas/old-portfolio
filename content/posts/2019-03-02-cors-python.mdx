## What is CORS?

CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) allows access to resources from other domains,
a good use case for this is a web app trying to fetch data from an API on another
domain. CORS is only required when trying to fetch data from a _browser_,
as browsers by default will block requests to different origins (domains).

CORS uses HTTP headers to tell the browser if it has permission to fetch the resources.

Browsers use a preflight header to determine if it has permission to interact with
the domain. This preflight header takes the form of a `OPTIONS` request, usually

sending the following HTTP headers to the server:

- `Access-Control-Request-Method`: The method of the request, e.g. `GET` if trying to get data
- `Access-Control-Request-Headers`: The headers that will be sent to the server

The response will usually contain the following headers:

- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`: The origins that are allowed to access
  the resource (specify '\*' for all)
- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`: The methods that are allowed on the resource, e.g. `"GET,POST,OPTIONS"`, remember to include `OPTIONS` in it,
  as its required for the preflight header
- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`: The additional headers that are
  allowed on the resource

## Implementing a simple Python server that has CORS

Python has a simple HTTP server built-in, that can be extended easily.

It can be imported like so:

```python
from BaseHTTPServer import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer
```

[BaseHTTPServer](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html#http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler)
is a base class that needs to be subclassed to do anything useful.
The most useful methods that can be implemented include:

- `do_GET`: Handles a GET request
- `do_POST`: Handles a POST request
- `do_OPTIONS`: Handle an OPTIONS request (which is the preflight request for CORS)

We create a small function called `_send_cors-headers` which sends the required headers.
Its important to add all the methods that you wish to use with the API in the
`Access-Control-Allow-Methods` header, which in this case is `GET,POST,OPTIONS`.

The `do_OPTIONS` method only needs to return a 200 response, CORS only
cares about what headers it gets from the OPTIONS request, not the actual response
body.

## Full Code

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer
from json import dumps

""" The HTTP request handler """
class RequestHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):

  def _send_cors_headers(self):
      """ Sets headers required for CORS """
      self.send_header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")
      self.send_header("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "GET,POST,OPTIONS")
      self.send_header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "x-api-key,Content-Type")

  def send_dict_response(self, d):
      """ Sends a dictionary (JSON) back to the client """
      self.wfile.write(bytes(dumps(d), "utf8"))

  def do_OPTIONS(self):
      self.send_response(200)
      self._send_cors_headers()
      self.end_headers()

  def do_GET(self):
      self.send_response(200)
      self._send_cors_headers()
      self.end_headers()

      response = {}
      response["status"] = "OK"
      self.send_dict_response(response)

  def do_POST(self):
      self.send_response(200)
      self._send_cors_headers()
      self.send_header("Content-Type", "application/json")
      self.end_headers()

      dataLength = int(self.headers["Content-Length"])
      data = self.rfile.read(dataLength)

      print(data)

      response = {}
      response["status"] = "OK"
      self.send_dict_response(response)


print("Starting server")
httpd = HTTPServer(("127.0.0.1", 8000), RequestHandler)
print("Hosting server on port 8000")
httpd.serve_forever()
```
