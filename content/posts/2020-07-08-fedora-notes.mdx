A few months back I switched from Ubuntu to Fedora, and I've been really impressed with how stable and fast the system has been.

Here are a handful of notes I've made during daily use:

## Using node-gyp

node-gyp compiles C++ based modules for Node.JS, it has a dependency on Python 2 (at least the version I was using).
The only problem is Python 2 has been removed from Fedora 32, but it can be added by installing `python27` package.
Once the package is installed node-gyp should work correctly.
