I have a Synology NAS at home, which acts as a file share that
my server writes to.
I ran into some problems using the default network share functionality in GNOME's Nautilus, namely unable to delete files or folders.
I suspect this is because of the file permissions, as the files are written by a app running inside Docker container (which I guess would be running as root inside the container).

The good news is mounting the network share via `cif-utils` and `fstab` worked seamlessly.

# Setting it up

1. Create a directory under `/media` for the mount point of the network share, I called mine `nas`, so I did `sudo mkdir /media/nas`.
2. Create a credentials file in your home folder, I create mine at `~/.smb` which should contain the following:

```
# ~/.smb
user=<NETWORK_SHARE_USERNAME>
password=<NETWORK_SHARE_PASSWORD>
```

3. Add an entry to your fstab file at `/etc/fstab`

```
# /etc/fstab

//<IP_OR_DOMAIN_OF_SHARE>/<SHARE_NAME>  /media/nas  cifs    uid=1000,gid=1000,credentials=/home/<USER>/.smb     0   0
```

4. Apply the changes by running `sudo mount -a`

The mount should now appear and you should have access to your files.
