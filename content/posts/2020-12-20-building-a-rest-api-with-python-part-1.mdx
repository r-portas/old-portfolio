title: Building a REST API with Python, Flask and SQLAlchemy - Part 1

I wanted to build a simple API and web app for meal planning with a twist. I wanted a service which could generate a weekly recipe list, finding the best way to reuse ingredients to minimize the amount of food waste and ingredients I have to buy from the shops.

To do this, I wanted to try out some frameworks I haven't used in a while, namely:

- Flask for the API
- SQLAlchemy for the ORM

The point of this series is to provide a step by step guide to building a fully fledged API. In Part 1 we will setup Flask and add a sample route, as well as using python-dotenv for loading in configuration.

## Setup

I'm wanted to give [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) a go for dependency management in this project, I followed the [instructions page](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) to install it.

To get started, I'm gonna create a new project using

```bash
poetry new backend
```

This will create the following directory structure:

```bash
backend
├── backend
│   └── __init__.py
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.rst
└── tests
    ├── __init__.py
    └── test_backend.py
```

Neat! Looks like a sensible file structure to get started with, now lets add some libraries we are using.

If your new to Python, the folder structure might look new to you, heres the important bits:

- The `backend` and `tests` directories are Python package (denoted by the `__init__.py` file)
- `pyproject.toml` is used by Poetry to manage the dependencies

Now lets add the Flask package with the following command in a terminal

```bash
 poetry add Flask
```

Next I'll add a basic Flask app to test everything out, which will just be the minimal example from [Flask's documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/#a-minimal-application), which will be added to `backend/__init__.py`

```python
# backend/__init__.py

from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'
```

which can be tested by running the following in a terminal.

NOTE: If your on Windows, the `export` part will be different, [see here for info](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/#a-minimal-application)

```bash
[roy@localhost backend]$ export FLASK_APP=backend
[roy@localhost backend]$ poetry run flask run
 * Serving Flask app "backend"
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

In a new terminal, we can test the app by curling the following address

```bash
[roy@localhost backend]$ curl localhost:5000
Hello, World!
```

It worked! Awesome! Its worth noting that the above command should only be used for development, Flask has [some documentation for deploying it properly](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/deploying/#deployment)

## Structuring Applications with Blueprints

Blueprints allow you split up your routes, which is handy for dividing your application into more maintainable bits, lets start by making a super simple blueprint called `ingredients` that we will build upon later.

Lets start by creating the following directory structure, the **bolded** bits are new

```bash
backend
├── backend
│   ├── __init__.py
# highlight-start
│   └── modules
│       └── ingredients.py
# highlight-end
├── poetry.lock
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.rst
└── tests
    ├── __init__.py
    └── test_backend.py
```

So this is what happened:

- Created the `modules` directory in the `backend` package
- Create a blank `[ingredients.py](http://ingredients.py)` file

Now lets create a blueprint inside the `[ingredients.py](http://ingredients.py)` file

```python
# backend/modules/ingredients.py
from flask import Blueprint

ingredients = Blueprint("ingredients", __name__)

@ingredients.route("/")
def get_ingredients():
    return "Hello world from ingredients
```

This will create a basic blueprint for things related to ingredients, at the moment it contains just one route, mounted at `/`

Now lets use the blueprint in our application by making the following changes to `backend/__init__.py`

```python
# backend/__init__.py
__version__ = '0.1.0'

from flask import Flask
# highlight-line
from .modules.ingredients import ingredients
app = Flask(__name__)

# highlight-start
# Register blueprints
app.register_blueprint(ingredients, url_prefix="/ingredients")
# highlight-end

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!
```

The **bolded** lines are added, in essense we just import the blueprint, register it and give it a url prefix of `/ingredients`

Next we can test that we can hit the new endpoint by running the following using curl

```bash
[roy@localhost backend]$ curl localhost:5000/ingredients/
Hello world from ingredients
```

Awesome! That means our url routing it working correctly!

## Configuration Management

The next step is to setup configuration management, a place to store configuration such as database connection strings, without hardcoding them inside our app. This means we can later package the app into a Docker container much easier, among other benefits.

I'm gonna use [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/), `.env` is a popular method for storing configuration and has implemntations in a lot of different languages. To get started, lets install the package using the following command

```bash
 poetry add python-dotenv
```

Next lets configure dotenv in our `backend/__init__.py` file by adding the following, the **bolded** bit was added.

```python
# backend/__init__.py
__version__ = '0.1.0'

# highlight-start
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
# highlight-end

from flask import Flask
from .modules.ingredients import ingredients

app = Flask(__name__)

# Register blueprints
app.register_blueprint(ingredients, url_prefix="/ingredients")

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'
```

Next we will create a dummy `.env` file to check that our variables are read correctly, lets start by creating a `.env` file in the top level of the project containing the following:

```bash
# .env
GREETING=Hello world!
```

`python-dotenv` will load the .env file into environment variables, so in the above example it will create a new environment variable called `GREETING` with the value "Hello world!".

Next lets reference the `GREETING` environment variable from our ingredients module, like so

```python
# backend/modules/ingredients.py
from flask import Blueprint
# highlight-line
from os import getenv

ingredients = Blueprint("ingredients", __name__)

@ingredients.route("/")
def get_ingredients():
    # highlight-start
    greeting = getenv("GREETING")
    return greeting + " from ingredients"
    # highlight-end
```

Next we can test that we can see the greeting when we hit the endpoint using the following curl command

```bash
[roy@localhost backend]$ curl localhost:5000/ingredients/
Hello world! from ingredients
```

So that shows the greeting we defined in the `.env` file, so it looks like everything is good to go. Now we will move onto setting up a database.

Thats it for Part 1, in Part 2 we will cover setting up the SQLAlchemy to store data in a database.
