## Downloading Debian

The Lenovo 100s is a Intel Baytrail device. One of those strange machines which has a 64 bit processor but a 32 bit UEFI BIOS.
This causes problems when trying to install Linux.

Fedora has supported 32 bit UEFI in their standard install image for a while, so any recent image should work without issue.

Ubuntu won't work, as they haven't included the 32 bit version of the bootloader. Its possible to add it in manually.

Debian has a multi-arch ISO variant, which works with both 32bit and 64bit systems.

I ended up using Debian, and there was a few tricks to downloading the right copy:

- Make sure to download the **multiarch** CD
- Make sure to download the image that includes **non-free firmware**, otherwise the Wifi chipset won't work.

I downloaded [this image](https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/current/multi-arch/iso-cd/)

## Installing Debian

The Debian install process works is the same as usual, except I ran into one issue.
I found that the laptop failed to connect to my Wifi when I choose the network in the installer, if I choose the "Specify SSID" option and manually type in the name of the network, it successfully connects.
