I have a dedicated Linux server at home, its a [Intel NUC](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/boards-kits/nuc.html).
I use it to host [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/), [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app/) and [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

My old solution for deploying these was to have a handful of Docker Compose files, but I wanted to replace it with something more maintainable and repeatable.
I also used this as an excuse for me to learn Ansible more.

## But why use Ansible and Docker over Kubernetes?

I imagine most people who read this would ask this question when seeing I'm not using Kubernetes to solve this problem.

I did some reading and thinking around this area and I determined that you need to reach a certain point for Kubernetes to be worth it.
Before I go into more detail I want to make it clear that this is just my opinion based on my experiments with Kubernetes and some reading I did.

- Kubernetes works best when you want/need your application to run across multiple hosts.


## My Goals

I have some goals of moving my homelab to Ansible,
namely:

- Easy deployments, I want to run a single Ansible command.
- Configuration versioned in source control. I shouldn't need to create any bespoke environment variable files. When I clone the source code repo it should have everything in that I need to deploy it. 
- Reproducible to other hosts. If I replace my Homelab hardware, I should be able to deploy to the new host with a single command.
- A prod-like dev environment. I have a Vagrant configuration that spins up a local VM which I can run the Ansible playbooks against.
This VM lets me test changes before deploying it to my homelab.

## Some Unsolved Questions

I still have some unsolved questions with my setup
