I've been following the development of [Traefik](https://docs.traefik.io/) for some time, since it was originally inducted
into the CNCF foundation.

They recently released version 2 so I figured I'd give it a go to deploy some infrastructure that I use,
namely [Matomo](https://matomo.org/) and [Drone](https://drone.io/).

I usually use Nginx as a reverse proxy installed on the host operating system and configure it as a reverse proxy to my containers.
However I was reading over the Traefik docs and it seems to provide an even easier way to configure routing.

To get started I'm gonna create a new `docker-compose.yml` file to store my configuration. if you want to follow along create a new folder put the following `docker-compose.yml` in it.

```yaml

```
