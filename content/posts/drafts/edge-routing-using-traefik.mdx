title: Edge routing using Traefik

I've been following the development of [Traefik](https://docs.traefik.io/) for some time, since it was originally inducted
into the CNCF foundation.

They recently released version 2 so I figured I'd give it a go to deploy some infrastructure
(namely [Matomo](https://matomo.org/) and [Drone](https://drone.io/)) that I use.

I usually use Nginx as a reverse proxy installed on the host operating system and configure it as a reverse proxy to my containers.
However I was reading over the Traefik docs and it seems to provide an even easier way to configure routing.
