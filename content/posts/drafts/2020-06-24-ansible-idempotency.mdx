title: Idempotency with Ansible

I've started my Ansible adventures a few weeks back, since then I've written around 8 playbooks.
The majority of the playbooks do fairly standard stuff, including

- Installing software through a package manager
- Run docker containers
- Template files

## What is idempotency in Ansible?

> Running tasks again should result in all them being "ok", not "changed"

## How to write idempotent tasks?

> Stick to using Ansible modules when available (e.g. use `apt` module over `apt install` shell command)
> You can have idempotent shell commands that still report "changed"

### Examples

```yml
- name: install nvm
  shell: >
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash
  args:
    creates: "{{ ansible_user_dir }}/.nvm/nvm.sh"
```

```yml
- name: enable backwards compatibility for cgroups
  become: yes
  shell: grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args="systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=0"
```
